As far as I understand the code, the display possibilities are very flexible, since I could implement a &quot;custom&quot; cell type by returning a rendered bitmap of whatever representation I would like. For edit mode, however, the cell turns into a text editor. Would it be &quot;easily&quot; possible to extend the FastWPFGrid such that I can return a custom edit control? Maybe you could point me in the right direction to get started.<br />\n",
